# Presubmission Enquiry

Dear Editor,

We would like to lodage a presubmission enquiry for our article entitled 
_â€˜plyranges: a grammar of genomic data transformation'_ to PLoS
Computational Biology for consideration as a Software article.

While there is a lot of software for analysing genomics data, they
require a familiarity with a multitude of UNIX tools and profeciency with a
several programming languages. Our software, _plyranges_, provides a coherent 
and consistent interface for analysing genomic data with the beginner user in
mind.

_plyranges_ develops a grammar for transforming genomics data with the aim of 
facilitating interactive and reproducible data analysis. Our software 
contributes a relational genomics algebra for reasoning about data measured
on genomic regions. As a consequence of our grammar, _plyranges_ can be used to
explore data from a wide variety of sequencing assays.

Our software is an open source R/Bioconductor package that has been
accepted for the next release of Bioconductor (available: 
https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/plyranges.html). This means
that it has gone under extensive code review and can be run on Linux, Windows
and Mac operating systems. As it is a Bioconductor package, _plyranges_ is
full interoperable with other packages in that ecosystem.

We believe that our manuscript will be of much interest to your readers, 
especially those interested in reproducible and accessible computational 
biology workflows.

If you have any questions about this work, please feel free to contact me.

Yours sincerely,

---

## Presubmission inquiry checklist

1. The software name and the address of the repository used for the software:
_plyranges_ is the name of our package. The development version is available at
https://github.com/sa-lee/plyranges and the stable release version is available
at https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/plyranges.html
2. The license used for the software: Artistic 2.0
3. A description of the software input, output, and the method(s) it implements,
including citations for previous publications of the method or software.
Input: BAM, BED, BigWig, WIG, narrowPeak
Methods included in the pipeline: statistical summaries, restrictions,
genomic arithithemitc, overlap and nearest neighbour finding. 
Output: same as input except for BAM
4. Between two and four keywords: Data Analysis, Bioconductor, Genomics,
Grammar
5. The number of users who tested the software outside of the authors group.
The software has undergone code review at Bioconductor 
6. The number of inputs analyzed during testing.
Our software has high test coverage and has an extensive test suite
that checks plyranges can read, process and write genomics data from
a variety of formats.
7. The number of examples (input files) provided with the software.
Most functions in the package have examples, there is a also an extensive
vignette detailing how to use _plyranges_.
8. Any other similar or related methods (with links and citations).
BEDTools and GenomicRanges
9. _A description of continuous integration of the software, a bug reporting URL (such
as bugzilla or github issues), and a mailing list or chat rooms, if these things exist._
The github repository has continuous integration handled via travis. This
service is also handled by the Bioconductor projects build system. Support for
users is available at the github repository or via
the Bioconductor support site (https://support.bioconductor.org)
